# Task-Manager MERN stack app with user authorization

This is a task-manager app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) with user authorization. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete to-do items, and requires users to sign up and log in before they can access the app.
*Note: You don't have to use a real email address to register on this app. It was done for convenience during testing, but any valid email address format will work.
